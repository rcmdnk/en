<p>Unfortunately, current version of <a href="https://rcmdnk.com/en/blog/tags/vimperator/">Vimperator</a>
doesn’t work with Firefox 47.</p>

<h1 id="firefox-47">Firefox 47</h1>

<p>Firefox 47 has several updates for Videos,
such embedded YouTube videos can be played with HTML5 video
if Flash is not installed.</p>

<p>Another update is for the synchronization, that
you can view/search open tabs from other machines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/47.0/releasenotes/">Firefox — Notes (47.0) — Mozilla</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, there are some changes related to addons,
and there seems some addons don’t have compatibility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/04/07/compatibility-for-firefox-47/">Add-on Compatibility for Firefox 47  Mozilla Add-ons Blog</a></p>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="vimperator--firefox-47">Vimperator @ Firefox 47</h1>

<p>When I started Firefox 47,
configurations of views in <strong>.vimperatorrc</strong> were not reflected.</p>

<p>I could use such <code>o</code> command and open a site,
but there was no complement, and it showed <code>Application is not defined</code>.</p>

<p>This is because Vimperator depends on
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Toolkit_API/FUEL">FUEL</a> library,
which was removed at Firefox 47.</p>

<p>Developers of Vimperator build new version for Firefox 47,
and released new version in GitHub just a short while ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/releases/tag/vimperator-3.14.0">Release Vimperator 3.14.0 · vimperator/vimperator-labs</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To install it, first you need to disable a signature check.
Open <a href="about:config">about:config</a>
and search
<code>xpinstall.signatures.required</code>,
then make the value to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Then, download
<a href="https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/releases/download/vimperator-3.14.0/vimperator-3.14.0.xpi">vimperator-3.14.0.xpi</a>,
drop it to Firefox.</p>

<p>If you try to click the xpi link directly,
Firefox rejects to install from these sites directly,
so that you need to download first.</p>

<p>It seems it takes a time to release it in
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/vimperator/">Firefox’s Add-ons page</a>,
therefore you need to install GitHub version if you need Vimperator with Firefox 47.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this <code>xpinstall.signatures.required</code> option will be
removed at Firefox 48.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/06/01/add-ons-update-82/">Add-ons Update – Week of 2016/06/01  Mozilla Add-ons Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think new Vimperator will be released in Firefox’s Add-ons page soon,
but we should be careful about these releases.</p>

<h1 id="account-in-mac-os-x">Account in Mac OS X</h1>

<p><strong>Account name</strong> and registered <strong>Full name</strong> are different.</p>

<p><strong>Account name</strong> is used for such home directory.</p>

<p>When you set up OS X, if you set only <strong>Full name</strong>,
then <strong>Account name</strong> is automatically set.
It is like a combination of <strong>Full name</strong>.</p>

<p>If you use non-alphabet characters,
it may be alphabets with wrong sound.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is much better to decide <em>*Account name</em> by yourself.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-change-an-account-name">how to change an account name</h1>

<p>Of course, you can change <strong>Account name</strong> later.</p>

<p>But it is not straightforward.</p>

<p>If you go <strong>Users &amp; Groups</strong> in System Preferences,
there seems only a setting of <strong>Change Password</strong>,
but no menu to change <strong>Account name</strong>.</p>

<p>To find such a menu, first unlock further changes
by clicking the left lower key
and put administrator password.</p>

<p>Then, right click (or <i class="key">⌃</i> + click) a user, which you want to change,
in the left side bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160519_user.jpg" alt="20160519_user.jpg" class="pic" /></p>

<p>It will show <strong>Advanced Options</strong>, so click it.
It will launch advanced options page and there you can change <strong>Account name</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160519_userdetails.jpg" alt="20160519_userdetails.jpg" class="pic" /></p>

<p>New account name should be different from any of existing accounts.</p>

<p>Usually you have only one account with administrator right,
but if you don’t have any account of administrator,
you need to create one administrator account and work with it.
(Need to logout and login as the administrator account.)</p>

<p>You can change only <strong>Account name</strong>, but normally <strong>Home directory</strong> also should be changed
to have same name with <strong>Account name</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>To change Home directory, you need to move the directory
before changing these settings in Advanced Options.</strong></p>

<p>In summary, to change an account name:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make administrator’s account if it doesn’t exist.</li>
  <li>Login as administrator’s account.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Move home directory to new account name.
From Terminal.app, you can do:</p>

    <pre><code> $ sudo mv /Users/&lt;old account&gt; /Users/&lt;/new account&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>Or open <strong>/Users</strong> directory by Finder and change <strong>&lt;old account&gt;</strong> directory’s name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open <strong>Users &amp; Groups</strong> in System Preferences.</li>
  <li>Unlock further changes by clicking the left lower key.</li>
  <li>Right click (or <i class="key">⌃</i>+click) account name which you want to change,
and open <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li>
  <li>Change <strong>Account name</strong> and <strong>Home directory</strong> to what you want.
(Normally <strong>Home directory</strong> should be like <strong>/Users/&lt;new account&gt;</strong>).</li>
  <li>Logout.</li>
  <li>Login as <strong>&lt;new account&gt;</strong> and check it.</li>
  <li>If it is fine, delete administrator’s account if you created it for this.</li>
</ol>

<p>It may sometime happen that
you forget to disable sound of a laptop
and bring it out then the laptop suddenly sounds unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Especially about Mac, it always sounds at starting OS X.
It is very annoying so that you may want to disable it.</p>

<p>Here, I corrected some methods to disable such a start up chime.</p>

<h1 id="simple-method">Simple method</h1>

<p>The problem of the sound in the outside is making sounds from an internal speaker.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are using an external speaker or a headphone,
you should keep the internal speaker in mute.</p>

<p>Here, you need to be careful that when you connect such an external speaker to Mac,
The menu in <strong>Sound</strong> of <strong>System Preferences</strong> (or the menu appearing when
the speaker icon in the menu bar is clicked with <i class="key">⌥</i>),
the external speaker overrides the internal speaker and it disappears,
while speakers/headphones which are connected with Bluetooth are
listed from them.</p>

<p>Therefore, it can easily happen that even you thought you muted it,
but it is just an external one and
it sounds at the next start up from the internal speaker.
The start up chime sounds from the internal speaker
even if you connect speaker with a code.</p>

<p>So, you need to change the internal speaker
after disconnecting all other sounds related thins.</p>

<h1 id="volume-reset">Volume Reset</h1>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/volume-reset/id495705418?mt=12&amp;at=10lc94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img width="100" class="alignleft" align="left" src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple6/v4/fb/6c/dc/fb6cdcb8-da7e-2487-5045-e282503c551d/AppIcon.100x100-75.png" style="border-radius: 20px 20px 20px 20px;-moz-border-radius: 20px 20px 20px 20px;-webkit-border-radius: 20px 20px 20px 20px;box-shadow: 1px 4px 6px 1px #999999;-moz-box-shadow: 1px 4px 6px 1px #999999;-webkit-box-shadow: 1px 4px 6px 1px #999999;margin: -5px 15px 1px 5px;" /></a><strong> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/volume-reset/id495705418?mt=12&amp;at=10lc94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Volume Reset 1.3(Free)</a></strong></p>

<p>Volume Rest is a menu bar application
which can change a volume at such <strong>Shutting down</strong> or <strong>Sleeping</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160518_volumereset.jpg" alt="volumereset" class="pic" /></p>

<p>Here, if you set <strong>Mute</strong> when <strong>Shutting down</strong>,
then a start up chime is not sounded.</p>

<p>If you want to just stop a start up chime
but want to keep a sound level after booting,
you can use <strong>Restore Volume</strong> option.</p>

<p>I like this application because it can also change a sound level
at <strong>Sleeping</strong>.
In these days, normally I don’t make a laptop shut down but make in a sleep
when I bring it out,
so I need to change a sound level especially at the sleeping.</p>

<p>So that I set like above picture: the level is <strong>Mute</strong>, Reset volume when both <strong>Shutting down</strong> and <strong>Sleeping</strong>,
not <strong>Restore volume</strong>, and <strong>Open at login</strong>.</p>

<p>It should be noted that
this application changes a sound level of what is currently used.</p>

<p>So if you connect a headphone, and make Mac sleep,
then a sound level of the headphone is changed,
an internal speaker’s level is not changed.</p>

<h1 id="other-applicationssettings">Other applications/settings</h1>

<h2 id="systemaudiovolume-of-vnram">SystemAudioVolume of VNRAM</h2>

<p>NVRAM(Non-Volatile RAM) is a small memory
which has information of such speaker’s volume or display’s resolution<sup id="fninref:1"><a href="#fnin:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In it, there is <strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong>
and some articles say that a start up chime’s sound level can be changed by this parameter.</p>

<p>You can check the parameter by <code>nvram -p</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ nvram -p | grep SystemAudioVolume
SystemAudioVolumeDB     %ee
SystemAudioVolume       [
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong> is <code>[</code> (=0x5B).</p>

<p><strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong> can have value within 0x0 to 0x7f,
so 0x5B is ~70%.</p>

<p>To set new value, put value starting with <code>%</code>, like</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%00
</code></pre>

<p>But when I tried it, sometime it worked,
but sometime not and the value of <strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong> was restored to <code>[</code>.</p>

<p>It seems other people also meet similar situation
<sup id="fninref:2"><a href="#fnin:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This method seems unstable and can not be used for now.</p>

<p>I found some articles argue about <strong>SystemSoundVolume</strong>,
but I think it is just a typo (or <strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong> was such a name before…?).</p>

<h2 id="startninja">StartNinja</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.allvu.com/index.php/products/startninja.html">StartNinja</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>StartNinja is an application to suppress a start up chime
with a cute icon.</p>

<p>It can be used in Yosemite, too.</p>

<p>If you are using Homebrew, you can install it by Homebrew Cask:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew cask install startninja
</code></pre>

<p>When you launch the application, you will see following window:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160518_ninjaon.jpg" alt="ninjaon" class="pic" /></p>

<p>First, push <strong>Get Current Setting</strong>, then you can change <strong>ON</strong> or <strong>OFF</strong>.
Above status means <strong>ON</strong>, i.e. a start up chime is sounded.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160518_ninjaoff.jpg" alt="ninjaoff" class="pic" /></p>

<p>If you set <strong>OFF</strong>, it is disabled.</p>

<p>Once it is set, the application is not needed to be run.</p>

<p>It affects only on the start up chime,
so a sound level after booting is not changed.</p>

<p>I checked above <strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong>, but it seems it doesn’t change it,
so it changes something different.</p>

<p>As written in the window,
the setting is removed if StartNinja application is removed.
It means the application implements some tasks at a shutting down and booting,
so maybe it just changes a sound level and restores.</p>

<p>This application also changes what is currently used.
Therefore, if an external speaker/headphone is connected
and an internal speaker’s sound level is not zero,
a start up chime is sounded at booting even if you set <strong>OFF</strong> at StartNinja.</p>

<h2 id="mutecon">MuteCon</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/macbs/download.htm#MuteCon">MuteCon</a>t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also an application which changes a sound level and restore at shutting down/booting.</p>

<p>It needs to be run, so you need to launch it at login.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t have a function to set to load at login,
therefore you need to put it in the start up items by yourself.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have a function to change at sleeping,
so I think Volume Reset is better to be used.</p>

<h2 id="psst">Psst</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/16780/psst">Psst for Mac  MacUpdate</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It just changes a sound level at shutting down.</p>

<p>When it is launched, you will see following window:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160518_psstinactive.jpg" alt="psstinactive" class="pic" /></p>

<p>then, set <strong>Start Psst</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160518_psstactive.jpg" alt="psstactive" class="pic" /></p>

<p>Under this condition,
a sound level will be changed at shutting down.
It is not needed to keep the application running.</p>

<p>But it works only once.</p>

<p>After rebooting, you need to set it again,
so it is not so useful…</p>

<h2 id="startupsoundprefpane">StartupSound.prefPane</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/16425/startupsound.prefpane">StartupSound.prefPane for Mac  MacUpdate</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>StarupSound.prefPane adds new menu to manage a start up chime in System Preferences.</p>

<p>But it seems it is no longer compatible after Marvericks.</p>

<h2 id="bequiet">beQUIET</h2>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/bequiet/id449472645?mt=12&amp;at=10lc94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img width="100" class="alignleft" align="left" src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple/v4/df/69/e1/df69e14c-d722-9698-20bc-b7a33eeeec41/beQUIET251.100x100-75.png" style="border-radius: 20px 20px 20px 20px;-moz-border-radius: 20px 20px 20px 20px;-webkit-border-radius: 20px 20px 20px 20px;box-shadow: 1px 4px 6px 1px #999999;-moz-box-shadow: 1px 4px 6px 1px #999999;-webkit-box-shadow: 1px 4px 6px 1px #999999;margin: -5px 15px 1px 5px;" /></a><strong> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/bequiet/id449472645?mt=12&amp;at=10lc94" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beQUIET v2.59($5.99)</a></strong></p>

<p>This application changes a sound level of an internal speaker.
It has options to set a sound level of a start up chime
and a sound level after booting.</p>

<p>It is paid application, but it is different from above applications that
it can change an internal speaker’s volume level directly.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>I’m currently using Volume Reset as it satisfies what I want to do.
A start up chime is annoying, but there are more opportunities
to bring it under sleep and not want to make sounds.</p>

<p>I think it would be better if I can use <strong>SystemAudioVolume</strong>,
but it doesn’t work well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I usually set a sound level of the internal speaker to be zero,
and use a headphone at a desk.
But still sometime I use the internal speaker,
and Volume Reset works excellently.</p>

<p>By the way, though I have written about disabling a start up chime,
Mac has a function to notify problems by the start up chime
by changing a number of times or tone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768">About Mac computer startup tones - Apple Support</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you need this function, you should not disable a sound.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I want to disable it.</p>

<h1 id="sip-system-integrity-protection">SIP (System Integrity Protection)</h1>

<p>SIP (System Integrity Protection) is new security system
adopted in OS X El Capitan.</p>

<p>It is sometime called <strong>rootless</strong><sup id="fninref:1"><a href="#fnin:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>,
because it reduces authorities of root.</p>

<p>Under this security system, even root can modify limited files/directories,
and some processes are also limited to be modified.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160517_osxsecuritylayers.png" alt="20160517_osxsecuritylayers.png" class="pic" /></p>

<p>This is conceptual picture of El Capitan’s security layer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gatekeeper</li>
</ul>

<p>At the outermost, Gatekeeper
<sup id="fninref:2"><a href="#fnin:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
rejects to install applications which do not have a correct developer ID.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sandbox</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications, which are confirmed by Gatakeeper, are launched in a sandbox
<a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/what-is/security/">OS X - Security - Apple</a>.
This protects data of OS X from unexpected access/change by applications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>POSIX</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, as OS X is UNIX, it has an access control of POSIX,
which limits access/change authorities of each file/directory for each user.</p>

<p>In POSIX control, basically root can access/change all files/directories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keychain</li>
</ul>

<p>At the innermost, there is Keychain.
Keychain is special database which has such password information,
and is encrypted.
It is strongly protected and even root can not access directly.</p>

<p>In short, OS X’s security system can be described like this.
But there is a problem, until Yosemite (or say in Unix), that
if someone obtains full authority at <strong>POSIX</strong>, he/she can change everything
other than Keychain
<sup id="fninref:3"><a href="#fnin:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To solve this, new system which limits the authority of root.
(This is pictured as separated parts of <strong>Keychain</strong> in the above picture.)</p>

<p>Under this system, even if a user allows root authority to applications,
some parts in OS X are protected for sure.</p>

<p>But it becomes too strong and some applications can work under this system any more…</p>

<h1 id="filesdirectories-under-the-protection">Files/directories under the protection</h1>

<p>Protected files/directories are written in</p>

<pre><code>/System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf

</code></pre>

<p>Like this.</p>

<p>You can see such <strong>/System</strong>, <strong>/user</strong>, <strong>/bin</strong>, or <strong>/sbin</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, some pre-installed applications are also included.</p>

<p>In the list, lines starting with <code>*</code> means that these files/directories
are not protected even if they are under protected directories.</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>/user</strong> is under protection but <strong>/usr/local</strong> is not
and user can modify it.</p>

<h1 id="disabling-sip">Disabling SIP</h1>

<p>As described above, <strong>/usr/local</strong> can be modified,
but you can not make new directory under <strong>/usr</strong>,
so if <strong>/usr/local</strong> does not exist, <strong>/usr/local</strong> can not be created.</p>

<p>In addition, some applications are listed, too,
and it means you can not modify such icons of them.</p>

<p>To modify them, you need to disable SIP.</p>

<p>To disable SIP, first launch OS X in Recovery Mode,
start OS X with pushing <i class="key">⌘</i>-<i class="key">R</i>.</p>

<p>In Recovery Mode, you can find <strong>Utility</strong> in the menu bar,
and there is <strong>Terminal</strong>.</p>

<p>Launch <strong>Terminal</strong> and execute command:</p>

<pre><code>-bash-3.2 # csrutil disable
Successfully disabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.
-bash-3.2 #
</code></pre>

<p>After reboot and launch OS X normally, SIP is disabled.</p>

<p>To check it, launch terminal and execute command:</p>

<pre><code>$ csrutil status
System Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).

Configuration:
        Apple Internal: disabled
        Kext Signing: enabled
        Filesystem Protections: disabled
        Debugging Restrictions: disabled
        DTrace Restrictions: disabled
        NVRAM Protections: disabled

This is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.
$
</code></pre>

<p>It should be like this<sup id="fninref:4"><a href="#fnin:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here, it says <code>enabled</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>System Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).
</code></pre>

<p>but you can see that each component under it are all disabled.</p>

<p>To modify icons or creating <strong>/usr/local</strong>,
SIP need to be disabled temporarily,
so that it may be better to re-enable SIP after changes.</p>

<p>To enable SIP, launch OS X in Recovery Mode again,
and execute following command in terminal:</p>

<pre><code>-bash-3.2 # csrutil enable
Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.
-bash-3.2 #
</code></pre>

<p>Then reboot.</p>

<p>To check SIP, use <code>csrutil status</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ csrutil status
System Integrity Protection status: enabled.
$
</code></pre>

<p>Now SIP is enabled completely.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to use such
<a href="http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/">XtraFinder</a>
or <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/">TotalFinder</a>,
you need to disable SIP always.</p>

<p>These applications seem not compatible with El Capitan,
but you can use them if SIP is disabled.</p>

<p>But it is a bit unsecure if you disable all SIP functions.
If you see above 
<code>csrutil status</code> results, you can see that
SIP is separated in some groups.</p>

<p>For such XtraFinder, you can disable only a part by command of <code>csrutil enable -without debug</code>:</p>

<pre><code>-bash-3.2 # csrutil enable --without debug
csrutil: requesting an unsupported configuration. This is likely break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.
Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.
-bash-3.2 #
</code></pre>

<p>This enables all SIP functions but <code>debug</code> part.
This command can be used even if all SIP is enabled.
(It disables only <code>debug</code> part.)</p>

<p>After executing this command, you can see the status like:</p>

<pre><code>$ csrutil status
System Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).

Configuration:
        Apple Internal: disabled
        Kext Signing: enabled
        Filesystem Protections: enabled
        Debugging Restrictions: disabled
        DTrace Restrictions: enabled
        NVRAM Protections: enabled

This is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.
$
</code></pre>

<p>So, only <strong>Apple Internal</strong> and <strong>Debugging Restrictions:</strong> are disabled.</p>

<p>Such <strong>FileSystem Protections</strong> is enabled,
therefore you can not modify <strong>/usr</strong> even as root in this case.</p>

<p>Under this condition, you can use XtraFinder or TotalFinder.
If you want to use them, it is better to disable minimal part (<code>debug</code> part).</p>

<p>If you want to disable only <strong>FileSystem Protections</strong>,
you can use <code>--without fs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>-bash-3.2 # csrutil enable --without fs
</code></pre>

<h1 id="nvram-related-to-sip">NVRAM related to SIP</h1>

<p>I found some documents which show that SIP can be disabled not entering Recovery Mode,
for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.cryptomonkeys.com/2015/07/osx-rootless-boot-args/">Rootless and boot-args · Cryptomonkeys Consulting</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, you can disable SIP by using command:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nvram boot-args="rootless=0"
</code></pre>

<p>in normal mode, and restarting,
but I could not reproduce it.</p>

<p>In addition, it is said that a command</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nvram boot-args="-x"
</code></pre>

<p>makes the next boot to be Safe Mode.
But I can’t do it, neither.</p>

<p>NVRAM is small memory which has some OS X settings<sup id="fninref:5"><a href="#fnin:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In above SIP’s status list, you can find <strong>NVRAM Protections</strong>, so that
this is also protected by SIP.</p>

<p>Therefore, NVRAM can not be modified if SIP is enabled.</p>

<p>In addition, I found following article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.idelta.info/archives/sip-rootless-internal-in-el-capitan/">SIP/Rootless Internal in El Capitan  Delta’s Lair</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It explains what is changed by <code>csrutil</code>.
It is boot property data and SIP information is included in it.</p>

<p>For example, such <code>--without debug</code> changes only some bit.</p>

<p>But it says that such <code>"rootless=0"</code> is removed at El Capitan.</p>

<p>It seems that these SIP related things are changed so much since Beta version,
such that GUI application was there.
Therefore, you need to be careful about information
as it is very deep settings in OS.</p>

<p>All emails are forwarded to my Gmail account
and I send mails by Gmail for these addresses.</p>

<p>Previously, I used Thunderbird and no forwarding was used.
But Gmail’s web interface has become so useful,
and it is much easier to use it as I can use it with full my settings (especially filters)
if only I have a browser.</p>

<p>To add addresses, previously, SMTP server setting was easily by using Gmail’s SMTP server,
but recently it was changed a bit.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-add-a-mail-address-to-gmail">How to add a mail address to Gmail</h1>

<p>To add a mail address to Gmail, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forward the mail from your mail server to Gmail.</li>
  <li>add the mail address to Gmail, and enable to choose the address as a sender.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="forward-a-mail">Forward a mail</h2>

<p>This should be done in each address’ server side.</p>

<p>Normally mail services, such Yahoo mail, have a setting of mail forwarding.
Gmail itself has a forwarding function (<strong>Settings</strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i><strong>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</strong>,
and <strong>Add a forwarding address</strong> in <strong>Forwarding</strong>), therefore
you can manage all Gmail accounts in one account easily.</p>

<h2 id="enable-to-choose-the-address-as-a-sender">Enable to choose the address as a sender</h2>

<p>If you just want to read mails, above forward setting is enough.</p>

<p>If you want to send a mail as other address,
you need to add the address to Gmail.</p>

<p>To do this, go <strong>Settings</strong><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i><strong>Account and Import</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160515_address.jpg" alt="20160515_address.jpg" class="pic" /></p>

<p>and push <strong>Add another email address that you own</strong>.</p>

<p>Then you will see following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160515_addressinfo.jpg" alt="20160515_addressinfo.jpg" class="pic" /></p>

<p>Here, though <strong>Treat as an alias.</strong> is very confusable,
normally I choose not to check it.</p>

<p>If you check it, when you send a mail as outer mail address,
the mail will be remain as unread in your inbox.</p>

<p>It seems like to distinguish the address when you set <strong>Treat as an alias.</strong>.
So it seems inverse for me…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1710338?hl=en">Use the ‘Treat as an alias’ setting to manage ‘Send mail as’ account behavior - Google Apps Administrator Help</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, about <strong>Specify a different “reply-to” address</strong>,
normally it is not needed but set if you want to reply as different address.</p>

<p>Then, go <strong>Next Step</strong> and will see following screen<sup id="fninref:1"><a href="#fnin:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20160515_smtp.jpg" alt="20160515_smtp.jpg" class="pic" /></p>

<p>In the past, there was an option like <strong>Send through Gmail (easier to set up)</strong>
in addition to
<strong>Send email through your SMTP server</strong>.</p>

<p>But the option seems removed around summer 2014.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems not possible to use Gmail’s SMTP
and need each SMTP server of each address…</p>

<h2 id="set-smtp-server-manually">Set SMTP server manually</h2>

<p>But you can use Gmail’s SMTP server by setting it manually.</p>

<p>In above screen, put following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com</li>
  <li>Port: 587 (or 465)</li>
  <li>Username: Your Gmail user name</li>
  <li>Password: Your Gmail password (If you are using <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/intl/en/landing/2step/">2-Step Verification</a>,
issue a password for app from <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">My Account</a>.)</li>
  <li>TLS or SSL: TLS for 587, SSL for 465</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you have not set 2-Step Verification,
you need to allow accesses from less secure apps in
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps">Less secure apps - Account settings</a>.
(Or you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839">turn on 2-Step Verification</a>
in this opportunity.)</p>

<p>Of course, you can set different SMTP server for each address,
and it is sometime better
because some mail filters reject if a domain of the address and
SMTP server’s domain is different.
(Though it becomes less compared to the past.)</p>

<p>But it is easy to use Gmail’s SMTP server
especially when you don’t have SMTP server for corresponding address.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>It is very useful to manage all emails in one Gmail account,
because you just need a browser to see all of them and use functions with full settings (filters).</p>

<p>There is no <strong>easier to set up</strong> option to set SMTP server,
but you can still use Gmail’s SMTP server
if you set it manually.
So, you can add even addresses for which you do not have SMTP server.</p>
