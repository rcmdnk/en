<p>When I was working with ssh,
sometime a ssh connection was broken with a message:</p>

<pre><code>Read from remote host example.com: Connection reset by peer
Connection to example.com closed.
</code></pre>

<p>This is because that a connection is cut by a router
if there is no action for a while.</p>

<p>To prevent such a situation,
there are several ways like below.</p>

<p>In principle, it is cut because there is no action.
Therefore, if either a server or a client sends something,
the connection can be kept.</p>

<p>Of course it could be solved if you can change the router’s settings
not to cut even in such a situation.
But sometime router’s can’t be touched by you.</p>

<p>In such cases, you can use ssh’s function.</p>

<h1 id="solve-at-a-server-side">Solve at a server side</h1>

<p>If you are an administrator of a server,
following settings in <strong>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</strong> works:</p>

<pre><code>ClientAliveInterval 60
ClientAliveCountMax 3
</code></pre>

<p>Add these lines in the file (or edit corresponding lines)
and restart <code>sshd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart
</code></pre>

<p><code>ClientAliveInterval</code> sets an interval to send a message to the connected client
to confirm the connection (in second).
The default is 0, and it doesn’t send a message.</p>

<p><code>ClientAliveCountMax</code> is a number of repeats to try to send a message when
it fails with a timeout.
The default value is 3.</p>

<p>Above settings try to send a message 3 times with an interval of 60 seconds
(i.e. try for 180sec).</p>

<p><code>ClientAliveInterval</code> must be shorter than what the setting of the router’s cut timing.</p>

<h1 id="solve-at-a-client-side">Solve at a client side</h1>

<p>If you can edit the server,
you can use a client side setting.</p>

<p><code>ssh</code> has a function to send a message from a client side, too.</p>

<p>To use it, add following lines in your <strong>~/.ssh/config</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>ServerAliveInterval 60
ServerAliveCountMax 3
</code></pre>

<p>Here, names have <strong>ServerAlive</strong>, as they are for confirming
if a server is alive or not.
(and a server side settings are named as <strong>ClientAlive</strong>, to check a client.)</p>

<p>This is similar to the server side function.</p>

<p><code>ServerAliveInterval</code> sets an interval to send a message (the default is 0, not to send),
and <code>ServerAliveCountMax</code> sets a maximum number of trials (the default is 3).</p>

<p>With these settings,
you can prevent such a disconnection for any servers.</p>

<h1 id="work-at-putty">Work at Putty</h1>

<p>If you are working with Putty in Windows,
you can use Putty’s function.</p>

<p>It has a function to send a harmless packet to keep a connection,
called <strong>Hertbeat</strong> function.</p>

<p>In <strong>Connection</strong> of the setting window,
you can find <strong>Sending of null packets to keep session active</strong>.
There is a setting <strong>Seconds between keepalive (0 to turn off)</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcmdnk.com/en/images/post/20150118_putty.jpg" alt="putty" class="pic" /></p>

<p><code>0</code> doesn’t send a packet.
If you set it as <code>60</code>, it works similar to above <code>ServerAliveInterval</code>,
sending a packet periodically.</p>

<p>TereTerm also has a similar function.</p>
